#Estimate of Variability
Location is just one dimension in summarizing a feature. A second dimension is variability (dipresion).
It measures whether the data values are tightly clustered or spread out. 
Main reasons: distinguishing random from real variability, identifying the various sources of real variability
and making decisions in the presence of It
##Key terms:
###Deviations (errors, residuals):
The difference between the observed values and th estimate of location

###Variance(mean-squared-error):
the sum of squared Deviations from the mean divided by n - 1, where n is the number of datra values

###Standard deviation (I2-norm, Euclidean norm):
the square root of the variance

###Mean absolute deviation (I1-norm, Manhattan norm):
The mean of the absolute values of the deviations from the mean

###Median absolute deviation from the median:
the median of the absolute value of deviations from the median

###Range:
the difference between the largest and the smallest value in a data smallest

###Other statistics (ranks):
metrics based on the values sorted from the smallest to the biggest

###Percentile (quantile):
the value such that P percent of the values take on this value or less than (100-P) percent 
take on this value or mores

###Interquartile range (IQR)
the difference between th 75th percentile and the 25th percentile
