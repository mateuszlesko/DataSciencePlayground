## Time series data structures
records successive measurements of the same variable, raw material for statistical forecasting methods
use for data generated from IoT sensors
## Spatial data structures

In the object representaion, the focus of the data is an object (eg house) and its spatial coordinates.
The field view, by contrast, focues on small units of sapce and value of relevant metric (eg pixel brightness)
## Graph (network)
data structure are used to repesent physical, social, abstract relationships. Graph for social media will 
repesent a connection between people. Graph structures are useful for centrain types of problems such as network optimization and recommender system.
